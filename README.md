Machine learning projects from IB CS HL course, 2023.

## US Transit Safety
A K-nearest-neighbors analysis of data on transit from the Federal Transit Agency.
This was completed as a group project with Nandini Kanthi, a classmate. We handled preprocessing and combined two datasets into one, then looked into data normalization. After completing a basic kNN model, we looked into enhancing the performance of our model with different K-values, cross validation, and a random forest regression.
Though our model's performance was subpar, we were able to predict a low risk level for GoTriangle's upcoming Bus Rapid Transit projects, one of which would provide service to our school.

## UK Traffic Safety
An analysis of automobile accident severity based on various road conditions, using data collected by the UK government from 2005 to 2014.
This project was completed alone. A decision tree was used to create an easily-undersood model that could possibly advise my classmates and I for safer driving.
Random forest and boosting techniques were used to improve the model's performance. Generally, the decision trees generated put the greatest emphasis on speed limit, as well as the number of vehicles involved.
